#  Capturing MacOS mouse metrics

This is my file to capture mouse metrics on my macos in realtime. I send the metrics every 5mins to a mongodb server from where I display the metrics on my personal website. This is my first swift project so it took a little more time than expected (understanding the strong typing norms).

My personal website is https://adityaj2003.github.io where you can see my stats.
